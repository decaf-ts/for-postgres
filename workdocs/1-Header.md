# Decaf.ts for TypeORM

The for-typeorm package integrates Decaf.ts data-access abstractions with TypeORM. It provides a TypeORM-backed Adapter and Repository, a fluent Statement builder and Paginator, model decorators aligned with TypeORM (Entity/Column/Relations/Date columns/Primary keys), sequence utilities, index generation helpers, typed SQL operators and query containers, plus small utilities for regex and raw Postgres typings. This lets you use Decaf.ts models and repositories seamlessly on top of a TypeORM DataSource.
