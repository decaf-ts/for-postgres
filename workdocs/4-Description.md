### Description

The `for-postgres` library is a specialized adapter for the Decaf-TS framework that enables seamless integration with PostgreSQL databases. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for working with PostgreSQL, implementing the repository pattern for clean and maintainable database access.

#### Core Components

- **PostgresAdapter**: The central class that implements the Adapter interface from the Decaf-TS core. It provides methods for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), as well as utilities for managing database connections, users, and tables. The adapter handles the translation between your application's domain models and PostgreSQL database structures.

- **PostgresRepository**: A specialized repository type for working with PostgreSQL databases, extending the base Repository with PostgreSQL-specific adapter, flags, and context types. It provides a type-safe way to interact with your PostgreSQL database.

- **PostgresDispatch**: Handles notifications from PostgreSQL, enabling real-time updates and event-driven architecture in your application. It subscribes to PostgreSQL's notification system and processes incoming notifications.

- **PostgresStatement**: Builds SQL statements for PostgreSQL, handling conditions, pagination, and raw queries. It translates the abstract query representation from your application into PostgreSQL-specific SQL syntax.

- **PostgresPaginator**: Implements pagination for PostgreSQL queries using LIMIT and OFFSET for efficient navigation through result sets. It provides methods for retrieving specific pages of results.

- **PostgresSequence**: Manages sequences in PostgreSQL, providing functionality for getting current values, incrementing sequences, and generating ranges of sequence values. Sequences are commonly used for generating unique identifiers.

#### Additional Utilities

- **Index Generation**: The library includes utilities for generating PostgreSQL index configurations based on model metadata, helping to optimize query performance.

- **SQL Operators**: A comprehensive set of SQL operators is provided through the SQLOperator enum, enabling expressive and type-safe query building.

- **Type Safety**: The library leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time checks and autocompletion, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity.

#### Integration with Decaf-TS

This library is part of the Decaf-TS ecosystem and integrates seamlessly with other Decaf-TS components. It extends the core abstractions provided by Decaf-TS, such as Adapter, Repository, and Sequence, with PostgreSQL-specific implementations.

By using this library, you can leverage the power and flexibility of PostgreSQL within the structured and type-safe environment of the Decaf-TS framework.
